About
Mobile marketplace app that conglomerates results from other marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace, Ebay, Amazon, Wish, etc. The app will likely categorize the result  stating where the listing was derived from.  The consumer will either be taken to the source marketplace or be given the option to checkout from the app itself. 

Functions:
The user should be able to distinguish the source of the listing. 
The user should be able to run a query on the results.
The user should be able to go to the original listing.
The user should be able to checkout from the app. [May have to change this if we rely heavily on webscrapers instead.]
The user should be able to receive points for each transaction made through the app.
